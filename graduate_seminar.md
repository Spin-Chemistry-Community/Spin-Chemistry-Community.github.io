# Spin Chemistry Graduate Seminar Series

The aim of this series is to provide the opportunity for graduate students to present their research, improve their presentation skills, practice presenting in English (if English is not your first language), and to gain further experience in discussing their work with researchers outside of their group. 

We would like to invite graduate students to participate in the series by giving a 20 min presentation (+10 min Q&A).

3rd Wednesday of the month

Meeting is held [here](https://riken-jp.zoom.us/j/96309792382?pwd=9rbcZYgA7yfRPINS2MSsEXkoUQq9aJ.1)

07:00 PST | 10:00 EST | 14:00 GMT | 16:00 CET | 22:00 CST | 23:00 KST

If you would like to give a talk or require further information, please contact Lewis M. Antill (lewismantill@gmail.com)
