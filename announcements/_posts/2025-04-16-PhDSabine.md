PhD Positions in the Group of Sabine Richert

## PhD Positions in the Group of Sabine Richert

A PhD position is open in the group of Sabine Richert to work on a project on light-induced electron spin hyperpolarisation, funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The project aims to address the sensitivity limitation of magnetic resonance techniques by exploring the mechanistic details underlying the generation and transfer of light-induced spin polarisation. Details can also be found [here](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/545606231?language=en). The work on the project involves several optical spectroscopic techniques, transient pulse EPR spectroscopy and, to a lesser extent, transient NMR. 
Any interested candidates should contact Sabine Richert by email ([sabine.richert@physchem.uni-freiburg.de](mailto:sabine.richert@physchem.uni-freiburg.de)) or ([richert@chemie.uni-frankfurt.de](mailto:richert@chemie.uni-frankfurt.de)) for more information, including the application procedure.

There will soon be two other PhD openings in the same group involving the use of transient EPR 
i) for the characterisation of stimulus-responsive luminescent coordination compounds in the framework of a DFG-funded Research Unit (collaboration between 9 different research groups in Germany) and 
ii) to explore singlet fission-based spin state switching in germanium diradicals, in collaboration with the groups of Alexander KÃ¼hne (Ulm) and Benjamin Dietzek (Jena/Leipzig) as part of a DFG priority programme (+ PhD-network).
Interested candidates should get in touch via email for more information (there will likely not be a formal advert if suitable candidates can be found before the start of the project).
