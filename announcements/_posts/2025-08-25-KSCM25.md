Inaugural Korean Spin Chemistry Meeting

## Inaugural Korean Spin Chemistry Meeting

We are pleased to announce the inaugural Korean Spin Chemistry Meeting, which will be held on August 25th at N Center 86126

Spin chemistry emerged in the 1960s to explain the behavior of quantum spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs) observed in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. Since then, the field has evolved significantly, now encompassing a broad range of interdisciplinary applications, including animal magnetoreception, photosynthesis, quantum biology, organic spintronics, quantum sensing, radical information, magnetic isotope effects, spin qubits, targeted drug delivery, organic batteries, singlet fission materials, quantum cognition, chirality-induced spin selectivity, and solar energy conversion.
Given the wide-reaching implications of SCRPs across the physical, chemical, and biological sciences, this inaugural meeting aims to inspire, engage, and inform Korean researchers about the depth and diversity of quantum spin chemistry. We hope it will serve as a catalyst for future collaboration and innovation within this exciting and rapidly developing field.

Please refer to the attached file for the detailed program.

We kindly encourage those who are interested to participate.

Organizers: Lewis M. Antill (SKKU), Sun Hee Kim (KBSI), Hohjai Lee (GIST)
