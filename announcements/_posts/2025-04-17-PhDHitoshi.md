PhD Position in the Ishiwata Group

## PhD Position in the Ishiwata Group

A PhD position is currently open in the Quantum Bioengineering Group at the Institute of Quantum Life Science (iQLS), Japan, as part of a research project funded by the JST FOREST program. The project focuses on exploring biological applications of quantum sensing in various forms, with the goal of engineering new measurement modalities using novel materials and device structures. This includes the development of microscopes specifically designed for targeted biological applications.
As a PhD student, you will gain hands-on experience in quantum materials, optical hardware design, and software development for quantum-compatible microscopy (primarily in Python). Our group also has expertise in protein and genetic engineering for in-cell expression of custom-designed proteins, enabling fully integrated biological studies.
Interested candidates are encouraged to contact Prof. Hitoshi Ishiwata by email at [ishiwata.hitoshi@qst.go.jp](mailto:ishiwata.hitoshi@qst.go.jp) for more information. You can also find further details about our research on our [website](https://www.qbio-eng-lab.com/).
We welcome applications from motivated individuals with a passion for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of quantum technology and biology.
