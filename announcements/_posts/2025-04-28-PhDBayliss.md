PhD position: spin-based quantum sensors from chemically synthesised molecules

## PhD position: spin-based quantum sensors from chemically synthesised molecules

The [Bayliss Group](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/research/ene/quantumnano/quantumoptospintronics/) at the University of Glasgow has a PhD position available to develop versatile quantum sensors based on electronic spins in luminescent molecules.

For more information, please see [here](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/spin-based-quantum-sensors-from-chemically-synthesised-molecules/?p176570)

and contact Dr. Sam Bayliss at [sam.bayliss@glasgow.ac.uk](mailto:sam.bayliss@glasgow.ac.uk) to discuss further.
