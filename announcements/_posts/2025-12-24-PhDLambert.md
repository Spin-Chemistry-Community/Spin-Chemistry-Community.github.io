Two PhD Positions in the Lambert Group, Germany

## Two PhD Positions in the Lambert Group, Germany

The research group of Professor Christoph Lambert is offering two PhD positions for curious and highly motivated students. The successful candidates will work on the synthesis and physical characterisation (steady-state and time-resolved optical spectroscopy, electrochemistry) of **novel boron-containing molecular compounds with biradical or charge-transfer properties with an emphasis on spin chemistry**.
These projects are part of the recently awarded Collaborative Research Centre “BORONPro” (SFB 1762) in Würzburg, which promotes close collaboration between theoretical and experimental researchers.

**Requirements**
- A Master’s degree in Chemistry
- Previous experience in organic or organometallic synthesis under inert-gas conditions, and/or optical spectroscopy or related areas, is advantageous
- Good communication skills in English and the ability to work effectively in an interdisciplinary team
- A curious, self-motivated approach to research

**Duration**: Fixed-term position for 3 years, with the possibility of extension

**Start date**: From April 2026

**Location**: Würzburg (Germany), a beautiful and vibrant city with a rich history, strong cultural scene and excellent outdoor opportunities. [Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/) is one of Germany’s leading universities and is ranked among the world’s top 220 universities according to the Shanghai Ranking. The university hosts a large campus dedicated to natural and life sciences.
We offer: An international, collaborative and friendly research environment with state-of-the-art facilities and extensive expertise. The positions provide opportunities for interdisciplinary exchange within SFB 1762 as well as collaboration with international research groups. Würzburg University also offers comprehensive support services and additional training opportunities for all doctoral candidates [click here](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/graduate-academy/).

**Applications** (by email only, as PDF files) should include:
- A curriculum vitae (CV)
- A brief motivation letter
- A list of publications (if applicable)
- Degree certificates and transcripts for Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees
- A list of academic referees who can provide references
